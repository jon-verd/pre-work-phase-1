<h1>
    Pre-Work Phase 1
</h1>
<p>Git is version control software that we run on our computer.</p>
<p>Github is a remote web application that works with Git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
<p>ddc-web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code.</p>
<p>We add and commit our code to Git on our computer.</p>
<p>We push our code from our computer to GitHub.</p>
<p>We deploy our code from our computer to the bootcamp server.</p>
<p>
    DEPLOY and PUSH are different.
    DEPLOY is when we deploy our work to the server - which runs our code.
    PUSH is when we send our work to GitHub - which stores our code.
